To be used with the Vim plugin [SnipMate](https://github.com/garbas/vim-snipmate). As of now, contains a single snippet that expands into a step-by-step checklist (inspired by [The Checklist Manifesto](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6667514-the-checklist-manifesto) ).


To use it:

1. Copy this folder over to ~/.vim/ (or create a Unix symlink/Windows Junction under ~/.vim/ that points to this directory)
2. Change the folder (or link) name to `snippets`
3. Restart Vim, and try typing `checklist` in your HTML file, then press the snipmate trigger key (default: Tab). If it expands into a whole slew of HTML with checkboxes and labels, congrats, you're done!
